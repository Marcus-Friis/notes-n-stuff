# Math Pong

> Pong but with math ➗

## 💡 Ideas 

* Turn based math pong
    * Shooter writes function, defender gets x seconds to predict where the ball will end up
    * Display trajectory helper lines - level of hint could impact points
* Obstacles on course
    * Shooter loses if they hit the obstacle with their shot
    * Shooter loses if they go out of bounds
* 2-n players - shooter decides who to attack with their function
* Different function modes
    * Standard shooting with $f(x) = sin(x)^2$, where x velocity is constant
    * Vector function shooting with $\vec{r}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} f(t) \\ g(t) \end{pmatrix}$
* Cool space transformations and distortions, altering the coordinate space in either a linear or non-linear way
