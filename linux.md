# Linux Setup 

Quick setup guide to get a running Linux system. 

1) Install [EndeveourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)
    - Alternatively, try [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/).
    - Note that for some reason, it is laggy the first couple of boots, but becomes normal after a while.
2) Install [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/) - using [this install script](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland)
    - Use the [dotfiles](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots) that comes with the installation for easy to use default installation. 
    - In Hyprland, make sure to configure screen. Press `SUPER + shift + e` and pick configure monitors. Otherwise, refer to the [Monitors Documentation](https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Monitors/)
3) Install basic software
    ```sh
    yay steam
    yay discord
    yay spotify
    ```
