# Linux Setup 

Quick setup guide to get a running Linux system. 

1) Install [EndeveourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)
    - Alternatively, try [Nobara](https://nobaraproject.org/), or pure [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) if you're feeling brave.
    - Note that it may be laggy the first couple of boots, but becomes normal after a while. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
2) Install basic software
    ```sh
    yay steam
    yay discord
    yay spotify
    ```
3) To apply my a good default theme do
	1) Install [`konsave`](https://github.com/Prayag2/konsave)
		```sh
		yay konsave
		```
	2) Use command
		```sh
		konsave -i <path to file>
		```
	3)  Apply the theme with
		```sh
		konsave -l  # indetify the profile name
		konsave -a <profile name
		```
	4) Logout and login again, or if that does not work, reboot.
